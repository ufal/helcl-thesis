% It is universally agreed that context plays a vital role in human communication.

% při rozhovoru je kontext kromě toho, co bylo řečeno i to, kde, kdo s kým a za
% jakých okolností komunikuje. V případě korespondence je kontext omezenější

% In this thesis, we present two case studies aimed on this phenomenon. In the
% first study, we provide additional context to a \gls{nmt} system and observe the
% changes in translation quality. In the other case study, we go the other way: we
% limit the context available to the decoder and examine the model behavior.

This thesis is structured as follows. In Chapter \ref{chap:nmt}, we describe the
basics of \gls{nmt} as well as recent advancements in the field. % Chapter
% \ref{chap:context} summarizes the scientific contributions exploring the
% influence of context in \gls{nmt} from different perspectives. \JH{rewrite, NAT
%   chapter: \ref{chap:nat}}
%   We present two
% case studies focused on the importance of context in \gls{nmt} in Chapters
% \ref{chap:mmmt} and \ref{chap:nat}.
%The discussion of the results observed in the case studies is given in Chapter
%\ref{chap:discuss}.
