                  to conditional sequence generation, but are suffering from the
                  issue of high inference latency. Non-autoregressive (NAR)
                  models have been recently proposed to reduce the latency by
                  generating all output tokens in parallel but could only
                  achieve inferior accuracy compared to their autoregressive
                  counterparts, primarily due to a difficulty in dealing with
                  the multi-modality in sequence generation. This paper proposes
                  a new approach that jointly optimizes both AR and NAR models
                  in a unified Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework. In the
                  E-step, an AR model learns to approximate the regularized
                  posterior of the NAR model. In the M-step, the NAR model is
                  updated on the new posterior and selects the training examples
                  for the next AR model. This iterative process can effectively
                  guide the system to remove the multi-modality in the output
                  sequences. To our knowledge, this is the first EM approach to
                  NAR sequence generation. We evaluate our method on the task of
                  machine translation. Experimental results on benchmark data
                  sets show that the proposed approach achieves competitive, if
                  not better, performance with existing NAR models and
                  significantly reduces the inference latency.}

                  speed up decoding by allowing for parallel prediction of the
                  entire target sequence. However, modeling word order is more
                  challenging due to the lack of autoregressive factors in the
                  model. This difficultly is compounded during training with
                  cross entropy loss, which can highly penalize small shifts in
                  word order. In this paper, we propose aligned cross entropy
                  (AXE) as an alternative loss function for training of
                  non-autoregressive models. AXE uses a differentiable dynamic

                  predictions. AXE-based training of conditional masked language

                  they generate each token by conditioning on previously
                  generated tokens. In contrast, non-autoregressive seq2seq
                  models generate all tokens in one pass, which leads to
                  increased efficiency through parallel processing on hardware

                  achieves significant decoding speedup through generating
                  target words independently and simultaneously. However, in the
                  context of non-autoregressive translation, the word-level
                  cross-entropy loss cannot model the target-side sequential
                  dependency properly, leading to its weak correlation with the
                  translation quality. As a result, NAT tends to generate
                  influent translations with over-translation and

                  NAT to minimize the Bag-of-Ngrams (BoN) difference between the

  abstractNote = {&lt;p&gt;As a new neural machine translation approach,
                  NonAutoregressive machine Translation (NAT) has attracted
                  attention recently due to its high efficiency in
                  inference. However, the high efficiency has come at the cost
                  of not capturing the sequential dependency on the target side
                  of translation, which causes NAT to suffer from two kinds of
                  translation errors: 1) repeated translations (due to
                  indistinguishable adjacent decoder hidden states), and 2)
                  incomplete translations (due to incomplete transfer of source
                  side information via the decoder hidden states). In this
                  paper, we propose to address these two problems by improving
                  the quality of decoder hidden representations via two
                  auxiliary regularization terms in the training process of an
                  NAT model. First, to make the hidden states more
                  distinguishable, we regularize the similarity between
                  consecutive hidden states based on the corresponding target
                  tokens. Second, to force the hidden states to contain all the
                  information in the source sentence, we leverage the dual
                  nature of translation tasks (e.g., English to German and
                  German to English) and minimize a backward reconstruction
                  error to ensure that the hidden states of the NAT decoder are
                  able to recover the source side sentence. Extensive
                  experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets show that
                  both regularization strategies are effective and can alleviate
                  the issues of repeated translations and incomplete
                  translations in NAT models. The accuracy of NAT models is
                  therefore improved significantly over the state-of-the-art NAT
                  models with even better efficiency for inference.&lt;/p&gt;},

                  extend sequence models using discrete latent variables that
                  makes decoding much more parallel. The main idea behind this
                  approach is to first autoencode the target sequence into a
                  shorter discrete latent sequence, which is generated
                  autoregressively, and finally decode the full sequence from
                  this shorter latent sequence in a parallel manner. To this
                  end, we introduce a new method for constructing discrete
                  latent variables and compare it with previously introduced
                  methods. Finally, we verify that our model works on the task
                  of neural machine translation, where our models are an order
                  of magnitude faster than comparable autoregressive models and,
                  while lower in BLEU than purely autoregressive models, better
                  than previously proposed non-autogregressive translation.}

                  translation from left to right and every step is conditioned

                  this generation process causes fundamental latency in
                  inference since we cannot generate multiple tokens in each
                  sentence in parallel. We propose an attention-masking based
                  model, called Disentangled Context (DisCo) transformer, that
                  simultaneously generates all tokens given different
                  contexts. The DisCo transformer is trained to predict every
                  output token given an arbitrary subset of the other reference

  abstractNote = {&lt;p&gt;Although neural machine translation models reached
                  high translation quality, the autoregressive nature makes
                  inference difficult to parallelize and leads to high
                  translation latency. Inspired by recent refinement-based
                  approaches, we propose LaNMT, a latent-variable
                  non-autoregressive model with continuous latent variables and
                  deterministic inference procedure. In contrast to existing
                  approaches, we use a deterministic inference algorithm to find
                  the target sequence that maximizes the lowerbound to the
                  log-probability. During inference, the length of translation
                  automatically adapts itself. Our experiments show that the
                  lowerbound can be greatly increased by running the inference
                  algorithm, resulting in significantly improved translation
                  quality. Our proposed model closes the performance gap between
                  non-autoregressive and autoregressive approaches on ASPEC
                  Ja-En dataset with 8.6x faster decoding. On WMT’14 En-De
                  dataset, our model narrows the gap with autoregressive
                  baseline to 2.0 BLEU points with 12.5x speedup. By decoding
                  multiple initial latent variables in parallel and rescore
                  using a teacher model, the proposed model further brings the
                  gap down to 1.0 BLEU point on WMT’14 En-De task with 6.8x

                  which rely on a fixed, often left-to-right ordering of the
                  output, our approach accommodates arbitrary orderings by
                  allowing for tokens to be inserted anywhere in the sequence
                  during decoding. This flexibility confers a number of
                  advantages: for instance, not only can our model be trained to
                  follow specific orderings such as left-to-right generation or
                  a binary tree traversal, but it can also be trained to
                  maximize entropy over all valid insertions for robustness. In
                  addition, our model seamlessly accommodates both fully
                  autoregressive generation (one insertion at a time) and
                  partially autoregressive generation (simultaneous insertions
                  at multiple locations). We validate our approach by analyzing
                  its performance on the WMT 2014 English-German machine
                  translation task under various settings for training and
                  decoding. We find that the Insertion Transformer outperforms
                  many prior non-autoregressive approaches to translation at
                  comparable or better levels of parallelism, and successfully
                  recovers the performance of the original Transformer while
                  requiring only logarithmically many iterations during
                  decoding.}

                  sequence-to-sequence models that prevents them from massive
                  parallelization at inference time. Non-autoregressive models
                  enable the decoder to generate all output symbols
                  independently in parallel. We present a novel
                  non-autoregressive architecture based on connectionist
                  temporal classification and evaluate it on the task of neural
                  machine translation. Unlike other non-autoregressive methods
                  which operate in several steps, our model can be trained
                  end-to-end. We conduct experiments on the WMT
                  English-Romanian and English-German datasets. Our models
                  achieve a significant speedup over the autoregressive models,
                  keeping the translation quality comparable to other
                  non-autoregressive models.",
